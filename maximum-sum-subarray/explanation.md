### Our Problem

Given an input array that may contain both positive and negative integers, find the sum of continuous subarray of numbers which has the largest sum.

Example:

Input: nums = [-2, -5, 6, -2, -3, 1, 5, -6]
Output: 7
Explanation: sum([6, -2, -3, 1, 5]) = 7

Note:
Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) time and use O(1) extra space.
